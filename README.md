# Contests repo

Using rust-competitive-helper and heaveily borrowing from:
* https://github.com/EgorKulikov/rust_algo
* https://github.com/EbTech/rust-algorithms

# TODO
* Eulerian stuff (to build segment trees on and do queries on paths or subtrees)
* Extension: create map from values to positions
* Make ArqSpec generic?
* Magic tree abstraction -- does queries on paths and subtrees very easily.
* Read graph from n and edges
* kth order like we have in C++ with g++ libs
