# Tasks to upsolve

## Training Before the Olympiad

It's suposedely very easy but I was not able to solve it somehow...

## 01 Tree
https://codeforces.com/contest/1919/problem/D

I had incorrect solution which maybe has some good ideas but only covers a specific case.

## Random Query

Idea is quite obvious but then it's some kind of a standard dp optimization which I am struggling with.

## Turn Off The TV
https://codeforces.com/contest/863/problem/E

I was trying to count number of zeros, ones and >1 on segment but it did not work for some reason.

Then I though wait it's just PlusMin ArqSpec! But can PlusMin be even implemented? Maybe it's segment tree beads or something?

## Modular Sequence

I tried greedy but it didn't work so maybe it's some dp optimisation? With bitset or segment tree or something?

## Lexicographically Largest
FUUUCK I SPENT MORE THAN 2 HOURS AND CANT'T SOLVE THIS FUCKING C!!!!
