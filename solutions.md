# Solutions

Here are solutions for some tasks in text. The reason it exists because sometimes I am lazy to code.

### Little Elephant and Array

It screams "SQRT DECOMPOSITION"

We calculate number of occurences for each element in v.

Then for each query we check all number from 1 to sqrt(n) and all numbers that have >= sqrt(n) occurences (there are at most sqrt(n)) of them.

We can check using sorted index arrays (Map<usize, Vec<_>>). Complexity will be O(m*sqrt(n)*log(n)).

### Beautiful Numbers

This is combinatorics problem. Each number corresponds to a bitmask. Consider equivalence class where masks are split by number of ones. For each class we know if it's excellent or not. Now we just need to calculat sum of amounts of masks of excellent clesses. There is a combinatorics formula for it. TODO: how to calculate this exactly? It's easy and known but how?
