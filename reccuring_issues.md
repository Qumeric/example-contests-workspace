# List of reason why I get WA:
* Binary search bounds are wrong (1)
* Found answer with binary search but predicate is not monotonic (1)
* When checking divisors up to sqrt(n) only taking div but forgetting about n/div or vice versa (1) 
* Used usize when meant to use i64 (1)
* Use mod9 when mod7 was asked for (1)
