Will solve old edu problems, people say they are most edu.
I looked on some 1700 problems but they are too easy.

Will look at 1800 and see if they are too easy as well.
I allow myself to use this as backup if I can't solve c2ladders but only for 1900+ problems (or maybe 2000+, did not decide yet).

# 1800

## D. The Union of k-Segments
It seems that we just need to compres coordinates? Then just build segments from values >= k and decompress back?

Actually tutorial just makes this -1 +1 balance thing which is kinda the same
